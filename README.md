**‚öôÔ∏è Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following software installed:

**Python 3.12.5 (you can check by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal).
pip (Python's package manager), usually installed alongside Python.
Django (installed through pip).
MySQL Workbench
If you don't have these installed, download Python from the official website, and pip comes with it.

Follow these steps to install the project:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git](https://github.com/Daniel-Stephende5/IM2-Repository.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd NewDjango
cd myblogsite
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

For Windows
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
For MacOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
-If the project doesn't include a requirements.txt file, you can manually install Django and other dependencies as needed:

 pip install django
Check Python and Django versions: Verify that Python and Django are properly installed:

Python
python --version
Django
 python -m django --version
Set up the database: Run the database migrations to create the necessary database tables:

python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (optional, but required to access the Django admin panel): To create an admin user, run:

python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create a superuser with a username, email, and password.
Run the server: Once everything is set up, start the development server:

python manage.py runserver
You can now visit the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. The Django admin panel can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, where you can log in using the superuser credentials you just created.
